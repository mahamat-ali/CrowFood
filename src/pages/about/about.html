      Our History
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Started in 2018, Crowd Food quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence in Tobi. With
        its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele
        in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive
        on your plate the next time you visit us. The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to The Frying Pan, a successful
        chain started by our CEO, Mrs. Vedika Trivedi, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.
